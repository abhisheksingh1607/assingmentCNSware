Overview
This web application consists of an HTML file (index.html) and a CSS file (style.css) and Javascript file file.js. It creates a user interface with a navigation bar containing options for File and Edit functionalities. The main section displays a grid layout with two cells (Cell 1 and Cell 2). Clicking on a cell triggers a sub-grid display that should populate dynamically.
